# EternalHarvest
## Background
Eternal Harvest is a quest from the game Dofus 2 that consists in gathering an enourmous amount of monsters by capturing their souls, this can be done exclusively by defeating each one of the required monsters in combat. This process tends to be not only long in time, but difficult in execution due to certain in-game mechanics. <br>
The game, however, allows players to commercialize the items containing the souls of the monsters. This makes it possible for a player whose collection has repeated monsters (for any or no particular reason) to exchange souls with other players. This mechanic makes the quest very similar to a sticker-album-like system, where you need to collect specific cards, but you can always exchange with someone else, the ones that you have more than one copy of, since only one of each is needed. <br>
Currently, the only way players can keep track of the souls that they have and those still needed is by writing in a paper. This makes everything even harder.
## App
This app tries to create a friendly way to keep track of the inventory, allowing players to quickly save and make changes in their collection. It can also connect with other players and do the inverted cross product to tell the players what monsters should they exchange.
